# Data Science Assignments

## Overview
This repository contains Colab notebooks developed during my Data Science training program. The assignments cover a range of topics such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, deep learning models, and model evaluation techniques.

All problem statements were solved independently, and multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained and evaluated across different datasets. This repository serves as a demonstration of my practical understanding of core data science concepts and techniques.
